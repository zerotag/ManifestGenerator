# ManifestGenerator
Simple software to generate a text based manifest of a folder.

Not much to say, you would just execute, then simply select a folder, and where you would like the generated file to be placed.
Then the software will scan the folder, and its sub-folders (by scan I mean look the filenames, not the content) while generating
the manifest.

This is my first software, so don't mind my obvious errors.

It also includes a debug monitor if executed through the console (java -jar command)

# Update

It uses a small lib that I made, so it isn't included here, but it is compiled together in the store folder.
